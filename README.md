**Project Introduction**

Pestagram is one of the projects that I created during my education in the Python Web Framework (Django) course (March 2022). The website's purpose is to be a social media for pet lovers and gather them all in one place.

Technologies used: Django / PostgreSQL / Bootstrap / HTML / CSS / Functionality / Logged users can create, edit and delete their own pets and their photos, they have full set of permission on their own profiles as well, they can add comments too and like other photos / Admin users have all the permissions on the website / Tests
